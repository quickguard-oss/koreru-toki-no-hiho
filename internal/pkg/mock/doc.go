/*
Package mock provides mock implementations of various interfaces used in the application.

These mocks are primarily used for testing purposes, allowing for controlled behavior
and verification of interactions with external dependencies such as AWS services.

The package relies on github.com/stretchr/testify/mock to implement mock objects
that can be configured to return specific responses and verify expected calls.
